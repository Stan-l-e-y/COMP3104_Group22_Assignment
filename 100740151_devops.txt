COMP3014 DEVOPS is a course that is in the third year of the Computer 
Programming and Analysis program. This course will teach students about 
being good devops developers by giving us the tools to properly 
collbaborate with other students, learn how to do proper version control, 
and learning how to use various other tools. All of these combined will 
help us to be stronger developers durring the life cycle of the projects 
that we work on. 

We are currently working on the first assignment about collaborating with other students through one 
repository.
